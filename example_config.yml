# Settings for Audio Pattern Ranger (APR)
##
# This file provides a description of each configuration option available
# in this application, as well as the default value.
#
# APR will try to load a configuration file in the following order:
# 1) apr -c, 2) env[APR_CONFIG], 3) ./config.yml, 4) /etc/apr/config.yml

# Minimum log level to be retained
#loglevel: INFO

# Directory used for processing data
#workspace: _workspace

# List of bucket names for ML models
# NOTE: At this time, only one model is supported
#models: [badnoise]

# Monitor-Only Options

# Older recordings than X minutes will be deleted on rotation

# Length of each recording: (hh:mm:ss)

# Device used to capture 
# Find With: ffmpeg -loglevel warning -sources alsa

# Device used to capture audio
# Use None to disable video capture.
# Find With: v4l2-ctl --list-devices --all

# List of parameters passed to ffmpeg.v4l2
# Adjust this based on needs and device capabilities.

##
# Training-Only Options
##

# Minimum accuracy (%) before training will finish
#target_accuracy: 95

# Values closer to 1 increase variation between model generations
# Consider 0.01 for overall accuracy <=50, or 0.0001 for >=90%
#learning_rate: 0.001

# Adjust momentum in tandem with the learning rate. Typically 0.5 to 0.9.
# Increase momentum slightly if increased learning rate produces instability.
# Decrease if training repeatedly times out from producing identical worse accuracy.
#momentum: 0.8
